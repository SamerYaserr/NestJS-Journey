# NestJS-Journey

This project represents my journey in learning NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. I followed the official NestJS documentation to set up this basic application, which serves as a foundation for exploring controllers, services, modules, and more.

## Features

- Basic API endpoint setup.
- Structured with NestJS best practices for modularity.
- Ready for expansion with additional modules, providers, and dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/SamerYaserr/NestJS-Journey.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd NestJS-Journey

```

3. Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

## Running the Application

- Development mode:

```

npm run start

```

- Watch mode (auto-reload on changes):

```

npm run start:dev

```

- Production mode:

```

npm run start:prod

```

Once running, the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Main application code.
- `app.module.ts`: Root module that bootstraps the app.
- `main.ts`: Entry point to start the NestJS app.
- `nest-cli.json`: Configuration for NestJS CLI.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts.

## Learning Resources
